## Introduction
Welcome to my data analysis journey| As a learner, I’ve been thrilled to dive into the world of numbers and insights. One exciting project that stands out was my work on a fictional dataset in Excel, where I learnt and tried out data visualization for showing variables in situations. By leveraging column tables, bar charts, and pie charts, I revealed distinct patterns and correlations within the data. 

-For instance, I discovered that [“Corrie Ten Boom’s book price was highest amongst other authors’ book prices, accounting for 43% of total prices”].  This, thus not only honed my interest in Excel but also showed me the power of data visualization in any situation. I’m eager to continue learning, exploring as well as excited to share my experience with you.
